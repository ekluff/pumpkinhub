# Pumpkinhub

Pumpkinhub is a fall events aggregator for all those that love autumn. It is powered by Ember.js.

In its final form, Pumpkinhub is will feature a number of posts that are tagged with categories (e.g., events, recipes, etc.). The title of each category will be displayed on the main page; clicking on that title will take the user to a page that displays all posts tagged with that category. Clicking a post will then display a post detail page. Users will be able to add events to the categories, and add comments to the events. Eventually, the site may feature user authentication to allow additional features.
